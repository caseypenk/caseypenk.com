    <h2>movies</h2>
    <h3><em>spider-man: no way home</em> (2021)</h3>
    <p>already-dated cgi, throwaway one-liners, and an over-reliance on the marvel affiliation mar what should have been the ultimate spider-man crossover and cheapen what should have felt like a stunning and unprecedented use of the most legendary actors from the franchise’s back catalog but instead felt awkward and anticlimactic</p>
    
    <h3><em>matrix resurrections</em> (2021)</h3>
    <p>nostalgic in the first quarter, metaphysical in the second quarter, and excessively violent in the very long second half, during which i aged 40 years and underwent multiple psychotic breaks</p>
    
    <h3><em>don't look up</em> (2021)</h3>
    <p>nihilistic invective against anti-science acolytes; every actor was better in another movie, except timothée chalamet, who brings something unique and beautiful to every single role he plays, including this (literally) earth-shattering performance as a christian delivering what are essentially the last rites of the human species</p>
    
    <h3><em>dune</em> (2021)</h3>
    <p>i spontaneously began crying at several points in the movie, due both to the astoundingly gorgeous cinematography and to the civilization-scale injustice that manages to make our human crises feel both manageable by comparison but also like "holy war, spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire"; timothée chalamet carries the entire movie but is supported by the most well-rounded and capable cast of any sci-fi movie since interstellar or even blade runner </p>
    
    <h2>games</h2>
    <h3><em>ocarina of time</em> (1998)</h3>
    <p>an unparalleled masterpiece still stunning in its scope, ambition, narrative eloquence, thematic resonance, and cohesive lore, becomes the greatest game of all time when combined with koji kondo’s eternal soundtrack</p>
