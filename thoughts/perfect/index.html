    <h1 class="subtitle">you are already perfect</h1>
    <br />
    <p>Why are you so hard on yourself about your body? You're already perfect.</h3>
            
            <p>Many religious faiths talk about how truly wonderful, remarkable, and special the human body is:</h3>
            
            <p class="second">“For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.’”<br />— 1 Samuel 16:7 (ESV), also found in Samuel 16:7 in the Hebrew Bible</p>
            
            <p class="second">“For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.”<br />— Ephesians 2:10 (NLT)</p>
            
            <p class="second">“The human body, at peace with itself, is more precious than the rarest gem. Cherish your body, it is yours this one time only. The human form is won with difficulty, it is easy to lose.”<br />— Tsongkhapa, Tibetan Buddhist monk (c. 1357–1419)</p>
            
            <p>From a scientific perspective, there are so many reasons that your body is magnificent.</h3>
            
            <p>Remember that the human brain has evolved over billions of years to become the most intelligent and creative thing known to exist in the entire Universe. You are capable of feats of imagination that are literally unimaginable to most of your ancestors.</h3>
            
            <h2>body fat?</h2>
            <p>It's a sign that you're not starving like some of your ancestors did. They probably hoped that some day, their descendants would be able to live comfortably, without having to worry about where their next meal would come from. The body stores excess energy as fat. Excess energy points to a wealthy society with plenty to eat.</h3>
            
            <h2>Unhappy with any of your facial features?</h2>
            <p>Let me quote the lovely and heartwarming K-pop band Treasure:</h3>
            
            <p class="second">웃을 때 더 예뻐 넌</p>
                
            <p class="second">You're prettier when you smile</p>
            
            <p>Seriously, go smile at yourself in the mirror. You're absolutely beautiful.</h3>
            
            <h2>feeling old?</h2>
            <p>The only reason you are capable of having this feeling is because you don't have to think about survival every day, and because you will probably live past the year 50, so you have a long life to live. Neither of these things was true for your ancestors—the ones who sacrificed so much so you could live a long, healthy life, and one day die a peaceful, natural death, rather than one of starvation or death by predator.</h3>
            
            <h2>Feeling physically weak?</h2>
            <p>Every single one of your ancestors was strong enough to survive in its environment, which was often incredibly dangerous (forests, savannas, and so on), and in fact lived to an age old enough to reproduce. This is no small feat. And this alone is convincing evidence that you are capable of being more than strong enough for anything you need to do.</h3>
            
            <h2>bags under your eyes?</h2>
            <p>We know these are often caused by a lack of sleep. If so, give yourself credit for working hard at whatever you were doing (whether that was a video game or a personal project or something else entirely). I often find myself staying up late, but that's partly because I work so many hours that I have little free time on the weekdays. Let's remember that sleep deprivation is often just a symptom of the society we work in: always on, always up, working long hours. The thing is, we now live in the most productive age in the history of the world, and our world gets more productive every year. This means that it's possible for our society to drastically reduce the number of hours each person needs to work (by half or more)—and we would still be stunningly productive. Until then, all we need to do is to take care of our bodies by consistently giving ourselves enough sleep. This is my most important physical and mental health priority and you might consider making it yours as well.</h3>
            
            <h2>scars?</h2>
            <p>They show the pain you've endured, the bravery you've shown, the seemingly impossible odds you've overcome. They are quite a bit more valuable even than the kintsukuroi (金繕い), or golden repair, that makes broken bowls so beautiful.</h3>
            
            <p>So don't be so hard on yourself. Love yourself. Cherish yourself. Take care of your body with good food, good experiences, and good rest.</h3>
            
            <p>You are already perfect.</p>
