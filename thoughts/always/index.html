    <br />
    <p>We all want to understand what will happen to us after we die.</p>
            
            <p>From the perspective of your subjective, personal consciousness, this question is inherently unanswerable. No one who has been there can come back to tell us about it. The stories of those who were medically revived after "dying" provides a fascinating portrait of the true subjective psychological processes that take place at the moment of death. Still, they leave unresolved the many dilemmas about the fate of our "soul," "spirit," or "quintessence." These questions are probably best answered through philosophical, spiritual, and/or religious contemplation.</p>
            
            <p>Do we live on in the hearts of others? In the impact we make on the world? In a metaphysical state of unity with God? All of these are plausible and none are necessarily falsifiable—except, perhaps, by the ultimate falsification, the eventual death of the universe, if such an event does occur and time does stop forever.</h3>
            
            <p>The relationship between science and religion must be one of coexistence. Science answers certain questions about the physical world with extreme precision (or, in the case of mathematical formulas, arguably perfect precision, although we are constantly finding that our formulas are only splendid approximations of deeper underlying reality, which we are scarcely able to comprehend given that our brains evolved for primarily practical matters in only three dimensions of space and with a time horizon of only a few dozen years). Spirituality and religion, meanwhile, answer metaphysical questions (such as "why does something exist rather than nothing?" and “why do I exist?”)</h3>
            
            <p>Both domains—science and spirituality—work extremely well at their respective purposes, and each answers questions the other cannot—because it has no terminology to describe something from the other realm. 
            
            <p>And yet, too often, we see conflicts because one domain attempted to answer questions it had no business answering.
            
            <p>A handful of scientists are all too eager to disprove religion by making various observations of physical characteristics of the Universe and how it operates (through amoral processes such as physics, biology, and chemistry). What they sometimes fail to understand is that spirituality and religion are fundamentally concerned with a different set of questions. When it comes to what is probably the most important question anyone will ask themselves—"what is the purpose of my life?"—a physical description of all the processes your body has undergone for the past XX years will reveal absolutely nothing about what your life means. Only metaphysical descriptions involving an abstract, intangible, uncountable, uncommidifiable purpose (such as "love") can even attempt to answer this question.</h3>
            
            <p>Similarly, while some people attempted to use religious texts to undermine the well-supported theory of evolution by natural selection, most people remain unconvinced that humans were spontaneously created in a literal sense. Perhaps this is because most people, consciously or subconsciously, understand that the ancient people who wrote the great holy books—so magnificent in their language and messages—were not really experts in science. The scientific study of the origin of species had simply not been invented yet, and so there were no plausible scientific explanations for the origin of humans.</h3>
            
            <p>Thus it fell to storytellers to explain how we came to be. The writers of these texts spoke metaphorically about the journey of the human soul from conception to birth to life to death to the afterlife.</h3>
            
            <p>They did not specify exactly where Heaven is located, for instance, because it is a metaphysical question. Wherever it is located, it cannot be within our regular 4 dimensions of spacetime, because then it could not be eternal or unchanging or perfectly good in the way that Heaven is typically described.</h3>
            
            <p>Similarly, Hell cannot be a physical place because that would require us to teleport our bodies from the cemetery to somewhere else (maybe deep in the ground?), violating multiple laws of physics. So it is not that our body ascends or descends physically, but that our "soul" undergoes a journey of some kind.</h3>
            
            <p>I have absolutely no insight to share on what happens to our soul. What I can talk about is the currency of quantum mechanics, which is probability. A wave function (when squared to remove negative values) provides the probability that a given "particle" (an excitation of a field) will be observed at a given point. Similarly, we can predict with astounding precision what will happen to your body after you die.</h3>
            
            <p>It is almost certain—with a probability upwards of 99.99999%—that all of the following will happen to you, and then much, much more after that that I have no way of predicting but am happy to imagine.</h3>
            
            <p>We usually think of our legacy in terms of leaving behind certain interpersonal memories, exceptional accomplishments, creative works, and physical creations. These may indeed last for thousands of years but it bears remembering that eventually someone will say your name for the last time, no matter how famous you are. This will be the absolute and complete death of your ego, because the memory of who you were, as a specific person inhabiting a certain body with a certain name, will no longer exist in any real form. The concept of "you" as an individual will simply cease to exist.</h3>
            
            <p>Striving for permanence in a fundamentally impermanent Universe is no more feasible a goal than trying to preserve an old piece of parchment for the rest of eternity. Eventually its physical form will wear away and degrade into a multitude of pieces. Even if we are cryogenically frozen, eventually our physical bodies will give out, and eventually the mechanical pieces that replace the biological ones will give out too. Even if you are able to play fast and loose with your expiration date, we all have one.</h3>
            
            <p>But your legacy will live on much, much longer than this, because it started way, way earlier than your birth date.</p>
            
            <p>Let us first remember that you have always existed.</p>
            
            <p>You began as an infinitely dense, infinitely hot point. Every molecule, atom, quark, or string that comprises your body—and your parents' bodies, and their parents' bodies, and so on—originated in the Big Bang. You began as streams of super high-frequency radiation that eventually cooled and slowed until they could form matter. Clouds of gas formed. Stars formed. You largely began as light elements like hydrogen (which is simply individual protons) and helium. From there, most of the atoms that make up your human body were formed through intensely powerful nuclear fusion reactions at the centers of those stars. When they exploded they made it possible for the Sun and Earth and humans to form.</h3>
            
            <p>You come from atoms made largely in the nuclear fusion furnaces of long-dead stars. To be more precise, you *are* the atoms made in those dead stars. What that further means is you are the Universe itself. You are not separate from it. You are synonymous with the Universe because you are it and it is you. This means there is no ultimate distinction between different things (such as you or me, X or Y, past or future). They all come from the same point in space. They are all made of the same fundamental particles and forces.</h3>
            
            <p>When the particles that made up your body get distributed throughout the Universe, it is actually astonishing how many different processes they contribute to and how many different times they contribute to them.</h3>
            
            <p>The water in your body will be recycled into water for thousands of generations of future humans and millions of generations of other life forms. Altogether, you will pass through the body of many billions of creatures, and indeed you will become these creatures when you become part of their cells.</h3>
            
            <p>Other elements of you will fertilize billions of plants over the millennia. You will constantly be participating in the creation of life. And in this very real sense, you will get to live again. The particles that make up your body may not recognize that they came from you, but they will *be* you.</h3>
            
            <p>But your legacy will not at all be confined to your home planet. Some of your lighter elements, like helium, will eventually float away and escape our atmosphere. These helium atoms may reach a distant star. They may fuse into new elements. And when that star dies, they may help form the home planet, and then ultimately the body, of another living thing that bears no superficial resemblance to your current body and yet, on a fundamental level, *is* you. You will be present in the brain of this creature, and you will help create consciousness. In other words, you will act as the Universe observing itself as if for the first time. In your subjective experience as this creature, you may feel that you are unique and individual, and this will be true on a superficial level (since consciousness, when sufficiently advanced and concentrated, creates and centers a self that is self-aware). You may also feel that you are the Universe itself, and this will be true on a fundamental level. You may even realize, through scientific inquiry or metaphysical realization, that you are synonymous with all who have come before you and all who will come after you, and indeed all matter and energy.</h3>
            
            <p>And if you are synonymous with all matter and energy, that means there is no distinction between the part and the whole. It means that you are the Universe and the Universe is you. You are also God and God is also you. Consider for a moment the concept of a God who is omniscient—knowing everything that goes on at any given point. The remarkable thing is that information theory tells us our Universe is omniscient—it stores all the information of what has happened to it and no information can ever be destroyed. Since you are the Universe and the Universe is you, you already know everything there is to know. Because the kind of information the Universe needs in order to keep existing is simply the fabric of existence itself—the physical laws and characteristics </h3>
            
            <p>It seems mathematically likely, given ever-increasing entropy, that the Universe as we know it will end in a completely uniform, changeless state where time cannot pass (because entropy has ceased) and there are no meaningful distinctions between different points in space (because they are all identical in terms of mass, gravity, energy, and so on) that fundamentally resembles the conditions present at the Big Bang. This leaves open the possibility that another creation event could occur to bring space-time into existence again. And then it is theoretically possible that another one of you could be born, and live, and die. Perhaps most reassuringly, this person would be made of the same stuff—the Universe itself—that you were made of.</h3>
            
            <p>If the Universe can always be reborn in some form, you will never die.</p>
            
            <p>And if the Universe was never created, you were also never born.</p>
            
            <p>You have existed forever and will go on existing forever.</p>
